# Return oof sound effect
This program returns the old & iconic "oof" sound effect to your roblox installation.
The program is set to automatically run on startup so that when roblox updates, the program (eventually) takes care of replacing the new `ouch.ogg` sound with the old one *(again)*.

## Downloads

## FAQ

> bro what is this a virus ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€

no you can literally check the source code
for some reason it (sometimes) gets flagged by windows defender but its a false positive dont worry
> program does not work!!11!11!1

run the program as administrator, i even said it in the readme smh

other than that it might be a bug, and this was a random project I made out of pure boredom to learn how git works so don't really expect me  to fix it lol
> I want to contribute to the project and improve your shitty code

I yet have to figure out how GitHub works (no pull request mumbo jumbo for now ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­) so for now just send me the modified code on discord (OctaNebula#7531)

> bruh how do i get rid of this thing

To uninstall the program just delete the program directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\ReturnOof\).
